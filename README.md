# Code Refactor

The objective of this assignment was to take an existing code and refactor it to improve the overall structure.

Semantic html elements were used to replace the generic div element in the starting code and were placed following a logical order. 
Attributes were added to the images to improve accessiblity for screen readers. The CSS was improved by consolidating styles through the use of the new html elements and classes.
